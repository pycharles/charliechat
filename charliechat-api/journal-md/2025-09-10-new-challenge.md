# Day 1 – A New Challenge Begins

> I am an IT leader with deep experience in security, infrastructure and business systems, taking a one-week sprint to build a hands-on project. My goal is to showcase both leadership vision and technical execution to stand out in today’s competitive job market.

After nearly 13 years leading technology teams, I find myself at a professional inflection point. I started in DevOps and grew into leadership roles guiding security, compliance, infrastructure and business systems teams. I have built strategy, scaled organizations and delivered measurable results at enterprise level.

The current job market for IT leaders is competitive and fast moving. There are many talented people looking for fewer senior leadership roles, which makes standing out critical. Rather than immediately flooding the market with more applications, I chose to take a one week break to focus on something different: building a project of my own.

This project lets me step back into hands-on work and flex the skills that originally drew me to technology: programming, architecture and problem solving. The goal is bold yet simple: build something that demonstrates both technical depth and leadership mindset in one cohesive experience.

I am building an interactive site where visitors can explore my experience in a more dynamic way than just reading a résumé. They will be able to ask questions, experiment with the interface and discover a few hidden easter eggs along the way. This project touches multiple layers of technology:

- **Front-end & UX:** Designing with HTML, HTMX and SCSS for a clean, interactive interface  
- **Back-end Development:** Building with Python and FastAPI  
- **Infrastructure-as-Code:** Provisioning AWS resources with Terraform for reproducibility  
- **Cloud Architecture:** Deploying in a cost-efficient, scalable serverless environment  
- **AI Integration:** Powering contextual, meaningful interaction through LLM-driven responses  

I am approaching this as a one-week sprint to sharpen both creativity and execution. I will be writing here along the way to share progress, design choices and lessons learned. This journal is also a way to give readers a sense of my voice and approach, not just what an AI model says about me.

Day 1 is all about laying the foundation: setting up the infrastructure, deciding on tools and creating a clear vision for the final product. Tomorrow I shift from planning to execution - time to build.
