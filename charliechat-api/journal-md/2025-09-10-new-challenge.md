# Day 1 – A New Challenge Begins

> I am an IT leader with deep experience in security, infrastructure and business systems, taking a one-week sprint to build a hands-on project. My goal is to showcase both leadership vision and technical execution to stand out in today’s competitive job market.

After nearly 13 years in my last role, I now find myself back on the job market. My career has been a journey. I started in DevOps and over time I moved into leadership roles where I directed security, compliance, infrastructure, sysadmin and business systems teams. I have shaped vision, guided strategy and helped my teams deliver results at scale.

The current job market for IT leaders is competitive and fast moving. There are many talented people looking for fewer senior leadership roles, which makes standing out critical. Rather than immediately flooding the market with more applications, I chose to take a one week break to focus on something different: building a project of my own.

This project will let me step back into hands-on work and flex the skills that originally drew me to technology: programming, architecture and problem solving. The goal is simple. When I talk to a recruiter or hiring manager, I want to show them something tangible that reflects both my technical depth and my leadership mindset.

I am building an interactive site where visitors can explore my experience in a more dynamic way than just reading a résumé. They will be able to ask questions, experiment with the interface and discover a few hidden easter eggs along the way. This project will touch on multiple layers of technology:

- **Front-end design and UX** with HTML, HTMX and SCSS  
- **Back-end development** with Python and FastAPI  
- **Infrastructure as Code** with Terraform  
- **Scalable cloud architecture** for deployment  
- **AI services** that power meaningful, contextual interaction  

I am approaching this as a one-week sprint to sharpen both creativity and execution. I will be writing here along the way to share my progress, design choices and lessons learned. This journal is also a way to give readers a sense of my voice and approach, not just what an AI model says about me.

Day 1 is all about laying the foundation: setting up the infrastructure, deciding on tools and creating a clear vision for the final product. Tomorrow the real building begins.
